Banks offer various kinds of accounts and provide loans based on the requirements. Apart from it, there are other various activities like investments in market and different funds. Overall, the banking sector has a wide impact on the economy directly and indirectly.

There are many banks across the globe that are leveraging machine learning and AI in their daily routine and getting benefits out of it.
